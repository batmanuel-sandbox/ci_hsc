    We present the procedure to build and validate the bright-star masks for
    the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Strategic Subaru Proposal (HSC-SSP) survey. To
    identify and mask the saturated stars in the full HSC-SSP footprint, we
    rely on the Gaia and Tycho-2 star catalogues. We first assemble a pure
    star catalogue
    down to $G_{\rm Gaia} < 18$ after removing $\sim1.5\%$ of sources that
    appear extended in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We perform
    visual inspection on the early data from the S16A internal release of
    HSC-SSP, finding that our star catalogue is $99.2\%$ pure down to
    $G_{\rm Gaia} < 18$. Second, we build the mask regions in an automated
    way using stacked detected source measurements around bright stars
    binned per $G_{\rm Gaia}$ magnitude. Finally, we validate those masks
    from visual inspection and comparison with the literature of galaxy
    number counts and angular two-point correlation functions. This version
    (Arcturus) supersedes the previous version (Sirius) used in the S16A
    internal and DR1 public releases. We publicly release the full masks
    and tools to flag objects in the entire footprint of the planned HSC-SSP
    observations at this address:
